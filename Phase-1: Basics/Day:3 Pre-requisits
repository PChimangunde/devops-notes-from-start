### Summary

This video, presented by Abhishek, offers a comprehensive overview of the **day-to-day tasks and workflow of a DevOps engineer within an organization**, focusing on how requirements are gathered, processed, and executed. It explains the various organizational roles involved, the software development life cycle (SDLC), and the use of **Jira**, a popular project management tool, to track tasks and project progress.

### Key Organizational Roles and Workflow

- **Customers**  
  The starting point of all requirements. Feedback from customers (individuals or businesses) drives new features or improvements.

- **Business Analyst (BA)**  
  Acts as the liaison between customers and the business. Gathers requirements and documents them as **Business Requirement Documents (BRD)**.

- **Product Manager (PM)**  
  Prioritizes requirements based on business goals, competitive analysis, and feasibility. Sets timelines for feature delivery but is usually not deeply technical.

- **Product Owner (PO)**  
  Translates prioritized requirements into actionable items or **epics** (sometimes called features). Manages the product backlog and defines acceptance criteria.

- **Solution/Software Architect**  
  Responsible for creating **High-Level Design (HLD)** and **Low-Level Design (LLD)**, ensuring the technical feasibility and design of requirements. Works closely with PO and provides technical guidance.

- **Development Team**  
  Developers break down epics into smaller tasks or stories and implement them. They identify infrastructure and operational needs, such as Kubernetes clusters, Docker files, or repositories.

- **DevOps Engineers**  
  Support development by provisioning infrastructure, automating deployments, and integrating tools such as CI/CD pipelines. They do **not receive requirements directly from customers** but get tasks from developers or architects. They also optimize workflows to accelerate SDLC by automating tests and integrating security.

- **Quality Engineers (QE)**  
  Test the developed features and collaborate with DevOps engineers to automate testing.

- **Database Administrators (DBA)**  
  Manage database setup and administration.

- **Site Reliability Engineers (SRE)**  
  Monitor live systems for availability and performance, create dashboards, and notify teams of incidents.

- **Technical Writers**  
  Document features and processes for internal and external stakeholders.

### Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) in Context

The video breaks down SDLC with real-world roles:

| SDLC Phase          | Key Activities & Responsible Roles                                |
|---------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Planning**        | Requirements gathered by BAs from customers.                      |
| **Analysis**        | PM prioritizes requirements and assesses business impact.         |
| **Design**          | Solution Architect creates HLD and LLD.                           |
| **Implementation**  | Developers, DevOps, QE, DBA implement features and infrastructure.|
| **Testing & Integration** | QE tests, DevOps automates pipelines, integrates security.   |
| **Maintenance**     | SREs ensure reliability and uptime post-launch.                   |

The video emphasizes the complexity hidden behind seemingly simple customer requirements, highlighting the many layers of communication and technical involvement needed to deliver features.

### DevOps Engineer’s Role Beyond Infrastructure

- Implements **CI/CD pipelines** to automate testing and deployment.
- Integrates **security practices** within the development pipeline.
- Identifies and addresses inefficiencies in the SDLC to shorten delivery times.
- Collaborates closely with developers and QE to streamline software delivery.
- Receives task assignments primarily from developers during sprint planning or backlog refinement.

---

### Project and Task Management with Jira

- **Jira** is introduced as the industry-standard project management tool used to track requirements and progress.
- A Jira **organization** (e.g., "Amazon demo vala") can host multiple projects (e.g., "Amazon Fresh").
- **Product Owners create epics** in Jira representing large features or requirements (e.g., "15 minutes grocery delivery service").
- Epics are broken down into **stories or tasks** by developers and assigned to team members, including DevOps engineers.
- Jira uses **Agile Scrum methodology**, where work is organized into **sprints** (2-3 weeks cycles).
- The scrum team (developers, DevOps, QA, DBAs, technical writers) plans sprint activities, reviews progress, and conducts retrospectives.
- Tasks move through states like **To Do → In Progress → In Review → Done** within Jira for visibility and accountability.
- DevOps engineers update Jira task statuses and comments regularly to keep stakeholders informed.
- Jira dashboards provide management with real-time visibility on task status, blockers, and team performance.
